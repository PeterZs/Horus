Easing Curve Widget Design Doc
==============================


- Easing curve shows total shot evolution
- Horizontal axis is time, vertical is arc distance.
- Can change the time of any keyframe by dragging left and right, but constrained to dist.
- Can add additional other knots between kf times for interesting behavior.
- Can scale overall time which scaled everything.

Input:
- Total shot length
- Set of keyframes with associated time and associated distance along arc.
--- doesn't have to end at max time

API: [CB = callback]
- CB1: Time of keyframe changed
- SET: Scale entire spline [disable CB1]
- SET: New keyframe list [disable CB1, other knots stay the same, so sort into list]
- SET: Keyframe value changed  [time or distance, disable CB1]
- SET: Current time we're displaying.
- GET: Entire spline's knots
- GET: Get eased distance along arc given a time (or list of times)
