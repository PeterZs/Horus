Homepage: http://stanford-gfx.github.io/Horus/

This repository provides the source code for the tool presented in our SIGGRAPH Asia 2015 paper.

## Usage Instructions

Horus is an in-browser Javascript application with a custom Python backend. It relies on the Google Earth NSAPI plugin and Google Chromium. It has been exclusively tested on Mac OS X. Note that this is a research prototype, and contains experimental and untested code. It is released here to aid researchers in reproducing our results.
