# Horus: An Interactive Tool for Designing Quadrotor Camera Shots

Horus is an interactive tool for designing quadrotor camera shots. We describe Horus in detail in a SIGGRAPH Asia paper, which can be found here:

If you find Horus useful in your research, please cite our SIGGRAPH Asia paper:

Note that Horus is a research prototype, and contains experimental and untested code. We release it here to enable researchers to reproduce and build on our results.

## Installation Instructions

Horus is an in-browser Javascript application with a Python backend. It relies on the Google Earth NSAPI plugin and Google Chromium. We tested Horus exclusively on Mac OS X. Installation instructions can be found here:
