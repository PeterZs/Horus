# Horus: An Interactive Tool for Designing Quadrotor Camera Shots

Horus is an in-browser Javascript application with a custom Python backend. It relies on the Google Earth NSAPI plugin and Google Chromium. It has been exclusively tested on Mac OS X. Note that this is a research prototype, and contains experimental and untested code. It is released here to aid researchers in reproducing our results. 

If you have any questions about getting Horus up and running, email Mike Roberts at mlrobert@stanford.edu.
