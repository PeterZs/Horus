Horus is an interactive tool for designing quadrotor camera shots. We describe Horus in detail in a SIGGRAPH Asia paper, which can be found here.

Horus is an in-browser Javascript application with a Python backend. It relies on the Google Earth NSAPI plugin and Google Chromium. It has been exclusively tested on Mac OS X. Note that Horus is a research prototype, and contains experimental and untested code. It is released here to enable researchers to reproduce and build on our results.
